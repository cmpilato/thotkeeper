                          INSTALLING THOTKEEPER

What You Need
=============

To run ThotKeeper, you need a few bits of software.  Unfortunately,
this list may be incomplete, and we have no idea what versions of
anything are required.  Sorry 'bout that.  Anyway, here's the list:

   * Python [http://www.python.org]
     The Python programming language and interpreter.
      
   * wxPython [http://www.wxpython.org]
     Python interfaces to the wxWidgets cross-platform GUI library.


How To Install It
=================

Currently there is no installation step for ThotKeeper, per se.

ThotKeeper can generally be run directly from its source code tree
(either a working copy of the ThotKeeper Subversion source code
repository, or exploded from a ThotKeeper release archive).  On
Unix-like systems, you should be able to simply do:

   $ chmod +x ./thotkeeper   ### possibly not necessary
   $ ./thotkeeper

or, if that doesn't work, try:

   $ python ./thotkeeper

On Windows, you probably need to create a shortcut that invokes your
Python interpreter with the path of the 'thotkeeper' script as its
argument.  Or, if your Python interpreter can be found in the %PATH%
environment variable, you can run the following at a command prompt:

   C:\> python .\thotkeeper
