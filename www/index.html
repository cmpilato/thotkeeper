<h1>ThotKeeper &mdash; a personal daily journal application</h1>

<p>ThotKeeper is a simple <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> daily journal application written
   by <a href="http://www.cmichaelpilato.com/">C. Michael Pilato</a> for his wife, Amy.  Amy was recording journal
   entries on paper or in a growing Microsoft Word document.  Each of
   these methods has its pros and cons, but the cons frightened Mike.
   Paper is charming and personal, but gets lost or damaged awfully
   easily.  Word documents are digital and easy to backup, but bind
   the user to the availability of software which parses that
   proprietary format.  Mike figured an XML storage format would work
   just fine, and with enough GUI goodness to navigate the hunks of
   information in the file, Amy might actually be encouraged to write
   more.  So began ThotKeeper.</p>

<p>Being written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> means ThotKeeper runs on many different
   platforms.  And the wxPython toolkit uses native widgets on the
   various platforms.  So when running on a Windows machine, ThotKeeper
   looks like a Windows application; when running under Linux, it
   looks like a Linux/GTK application.</p>

<h2>What You Need</h2>

<p>To run ThotKeeper, you need a few bits of software.  Unfortunately,
   this list may be incomplete, and we have no idea what versions of
   anything are required.  Sorry 'bout that.  Anyway, here's the
   list:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> &mdash; the
    Python programming language </li>
<li><a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> - Python
    interfaces to the <a
    href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> cross-platform GUI
    library</li>
</ul>

<h2>How To Get It</h2>

<p>ThotKeeper's source code lives in a publicly readable <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> repository.
