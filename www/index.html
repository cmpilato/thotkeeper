<h1>ThotKeeper &mdash; a personal daily journal application</h1>

<p>ThotKeeper is a simple <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/"
   >wxPython</a> daily journal application written by <a
   href="http://www.cmichaelpilato.com/" >C. Michael Pilato</a> for
   his wife, Amy.  Amy was recording journal entries on paper or in a
   growing Microsoft Word document.  Each of these methods has its
   pros and cons, but the cons frightened Mike.  Paper is charming and
   personal, but gets lost or damaged awfully easily.  Word documents
   are digital and easy to backup, but bind the user to the
   availability of software which parses that proprietary format.
   Mike figured an XML storage format would work just fine, and with
   enough GUI goodness to navigate the hunks of information in the
   file, Amy might actually be encouraged to write more.  So began
   ThotKeeper.</p>

<p>Being written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> means ThotKeeper runs on many different
   platforms.  And the wxPython toolkit uses native widgets on the
   various platforms.  So when running on a Windows machine, ThotKeeper
   looks like a Windows application; when running under Linux, it
   looks like a Linux/GTK application.</p>
