<h1>ThotKeeper &mdash; a personal daily journal application</h1>

<p>ThotKeeper is a simple, open source, daily journal application
   created by <a href="http://www.cmichaelpilato.com/" >C. Michael
   Pilato</a> for his wife, Amy.  Amy was recording journal entries on
   paper or in a growing Microsoft Word document.  Each of these
   methods has its pros and cons, but the cons frightened Mike.  Paper
   is charming and personal, but gets lost or damaged awfully easily.
   Word documents are digital and easy to backup, but bind the user to
   the availability of software which parses that proprietary format.
   Mike figured an XML storage format would work just fine, and with
   enough GUI goodness to navigate the hunks of information in the
   file, Amy might actually be encouraged to write more.  So in 2004,
   he began working on ThotKeeper.</p>

<p>ThotKeeper is written in the <a href="http://www.python.org/"
   >Python</a> programming language, which means it runs on many
   different platforms.  It's built around the <a
   href="http://www.wxpython.org/" >wxPython</a> toolkit, which uses
   native widgets on the various platforms.  That means that when you
   run ThotKeeper on a Windows machine, it looks like a native Windows
   application; when running under Linux, it looks like a Linux/GTK
   application.</p>

<p>Others have since come along to help Mike develop ThotKeeper.  You
   can see their contributions &mdash; and even learn how to make some
   of your own &mdash; by visiting the project's Google Code site at
   <a href="http://thotkeeper.googlecode.com/"
   >http://thotkeeper.googlecode.com/</a>.</p>

<h2>What You Need</h2>

<p>To run ThotKeeper, you need a few bits of software:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org/" >Python</a> &mdash; the Python
    programming language (version 2.3 or greater) </li>
<li><a href="http://www.wxpython.org/" >wxPython</a> &mdash; Python
    interfaces to the <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/"
    >wxWidgets</a> cross-platform GUI library (version 2.8 or greater,
    and compiled for the correct version of Python)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How To Get It</h2>

<p>There are two ways to get ThotKeeper:</p>

<ul>

<li>Download the latest release tarball (currently <strong>version
    0.2.0</strong>) from the <a
    href="http://code.google.com/p/thotkeeper/downloads"
    >Downloads</a> area of the project site.</li>

<li>Using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>,
    check out or export ThotKeeper's source code from the <a
    href="http://code.google.com/p/thotkeeper/source/checkout"
    >Source</a> area of the project site.  If you want to run
    ThotKeeper directly from a working copy checked out from our
    source code repository, that's fine, but make sure you checkout a
    release tag (/tags/X.Y.Z) &mdash; the trunk is likely to churn,
    and we won't be able to realistically support the non-final
    intermediate data formats it might use.</li>

</ul>
