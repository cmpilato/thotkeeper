## ThotKeeper — cross-platform personal daily journaling ##

ThotKeeper is a simple, open source, cross-platform, daily journal
application.

ThotKeeper is written in the Python programming language, which means
it runs on many different platforms. It's built around the wxPython
toolkit, which uses native widgets on the various platforms. That
means that when you run ThotKeeper on a Windows machine, it looks like
a native Windows application; when running under Linux, it looks like
a Linux/GTK application.

## Features ##

  * Cross-platform functionality with native widgets
  * Simple, easy-to-navigate interface
  * XML storage format
  * Support for multiple entries per day
  * Per-entry authors
  * Hierarchical tag support

## What You Need ##

To run ThotKeeper, you need a few bits of software:

  * [ThotKeeper](https://github.com/cmpilato/thotkeeper/releases) —
    This one's obvious, right?
  * [Python](http://www.python.org/) — the Python programming language
    (version 2.3 or greater)
  * [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/) — Python interfaces to the
    wxWidgets cross-platform GUI library (version 2.8 or greater, and
    compiled for the correct version of Python)

## History ##

ThotKeeper was created as a labor of love by [C. Michael
Pilato](http://www.cmichaelpilato.com) for his wife, Amy. Amy was
recording journal entries on paper or in an endlessly growing
Microsoft Word document. Each of these methods has its pros and cons,
but the cons frightened Mike. Paper is charming and personal, but gets
lost or damaged easily. Word documents are digital and easy to backup,
but bind the user to the availability of software which parses that
proprietary format. Mike figured that with a simple XML storage format
and enough GUI goodness to navigate the hunks of information in the
file, Amy might actually be encouraged to write more. So in 2004, he
began working on ThotKeeper.

Others have since come along to help Mike develop ThotKeeper.
